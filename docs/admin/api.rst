WARNING: THIS DOC IS OBSOLETE AND HAS TO BE REWRITTEN

The OAR REST API is currently a cgi script being served by an http server (we
recommend Apache) that allows the programming of interfaces to OAR using a REST
library. Most of the operations usually done with the oar Unix commands may be
done using this API from the favourite language of the users. But this API may
also be used as an administrator portal as it provides you a convenient way to
create resources, edit configuration variables or admission rules.

Authentication setup
====================

The API authentication relies on the authentication mechanism of the http
server used to serve the CGI script. The API may be configured to use the IDENT
protocol for authentication from trusted hosts, like a cluster frontend. In
this case, a unix login is automatically used by the API. This only works for
hosts that have been correctly configured (for which the security rules are
trusted by the admistrator). If IDENT is not used or not trusted, the API can
use the basic HTTP authentication. You may also want to set-up https
certificates.

In summary, the API authentication is based on the http server's configuration.
The API uses the **X_REMOTE_IDENT** http header variable, so the administrator
has to set up this variable inside the http server configuration. Look at the
provided apache sample configuration files (api/apache2.conf of the OAR sources
or the installed /etc/oar/apache-api.conf of packages) for more details.
